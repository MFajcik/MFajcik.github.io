So it is here! Recently, I have finished my PhD state exams and I have realized that since the beginning of my PhD, I have been working on some interesting projects and I feel an obligation to share my knowledge with world.

In this blog, I would like to cover recent topics I have read about, worked on or I will praise the magnificent work of my students. If there will be something unclear in my future posts, please free to discuss this, as this is probably unclear to more people than just you :relaxed:.

That's all I have to share right now, see you soon!
