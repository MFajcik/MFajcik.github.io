I am a fifth-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing from <a href="http://knot.fit.vutbr.cz/">Knowledge Technology Research Group</a> active at FIT-BUT in Brno, Czech Republic, advised by prof. <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~smrz/index.php.en">Pavel Smrž</a>. My faculty webpage is available <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ifajcik/index.php.en">here</a>.

Concurrently, I am also a research assistant in <a href="https://www.idiap.ch/en/people/directory/932">IDIAP</a> research institute based in Martigny, Switzerland.

My main research interests are problems related to Open-Domain Question Answering. This includes topics such as representation learning, document retrieval/re-ranking, and machine comprehension. I am also interested in basically any open-domain retrieval problems, such as fact-checking or entity linking.

If you are a student looking for BSc/MSc thesis supervision in Natural Language Processing and you are not afraid :feelsgood: of doing the challenging research, feel free to <a href="mailto:ifajcik@fit.vutbr.cz">contact me</a>.
