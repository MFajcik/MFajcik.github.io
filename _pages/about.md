I am a final-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing from <a href="http://knot.fit.vutbr.cz/">Knowledge Technology Research Group</a> active at FIT-BUT in Brno, Czech Republic, advised by prof. <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~smrz/index.php.en">Pavel Smrž</a>. My faculty webpage is available <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ifajcik/index.php.en">here</a>.

My main research interests are problems related to Question Answering and Fact-Checking. This includes topics such as latent variable models, document retrieval/re-ranking, machine comprehension or faithful explainability.

If you are a student looking for BSc/MSc thesis supervision in Natural Language Processing and you are not afraid :feelsgood: of doing the challenging research, feel free to <a href="mailto:ifajcik@fit.vutbr.cz">contact me</a>.
