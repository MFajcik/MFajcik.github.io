I am a fourth-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing from <a href="http://knot.fit.vutbr.cz/">Knowledge Technology Research Group</a> active at FIT BUT in Czech Republic, advised by prof. <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~smrz/index.php.en">Pavel Smrž</a>. My faculty webpage is available <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ifajcik/index.php.en">here</a>.

My main research interests are problems related to Open-Domain Question Answering. This includes topics such as representation learning, document retrieval/re-ranking and machine comprehension.

If you are a student looking for BSc/MSc thesis supervision in Natural Language Processing and you are not afraid :feelsgood: of doing the state-of-the-art research, feel free to <a href="mailto:ifajcik@fit.vutbr.cz">contact me</a>.
