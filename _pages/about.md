I am a posdoctoral researcher in Natural Language Processing from <a href="http://knot.fit.vutbr.cz/">Knowledge Technology Research Group</a> active at FIT-BUT in Brno, Czech Republic. My faculty webpage is available <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ifajcik/index.php.en">here</a>.

My main research interests are problems related to Large Language Models, Information Retrieval, Question Answering and Fact-Checking. This includes topics such as latent variable models, document retrieval/re-ranking, machine comprehension, cross-lingual continued pretraining or methods for faithful explainability.

If you are a student looking for BSc/MSc thesis supervision in Natural Language Processing and you are not afraid of doing the challenging research, feel free to <a href="mailto:martin.fajcik@vut.cz">contact me</a>.
